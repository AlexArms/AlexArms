### Hey There ðŸ‘‹

I recently decided to pursue software engineering as a career path, so here I am. I started with a couple bootcamp's basic prep courses, and some miscellaneous Youtube videos. I ended up going through one of the bootcampsm, and have now been in the field for a little over a year as of January 2023.

The primary technologies and languages I am comfortable with are...
- Gitlab / Github / Git
- React / NextJS
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Node / Express
- HTML and CSS
- SCSS
- styled components
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Postman
- Robo3T
- Heroku
- AWS S3

But I've also got some expeirence with these!
- Python (algorithm problems and a couple commands in the terminal)
- Go (debugged a Golang microservice once, would like to learn more)
- SQL
- Docker
- Artillery.io
- Webpack
- Babel
