### Hey There ðŸ‘‹

I recently decided to pursue software engineering as a career path. I started with a couple bootcamp's basic prep courses, and some miscellaneous Youtube videos. I ended up going through one of the bootcampsm, and have now been in the field since January 2023.

The primary technologies and languages I am comfortable with are...
- Gitlab / Github / Git
- React / NextJS
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Node / Express
- HTML and CSS
- SCSS, styled components
- MongoDB / Mongoose / Mongo Atlas / Robot3T
- Postman
- Heroku
- AWS (S3, Lambdas, Athena, Gateway, IAM, Cloudfront, Secrets Manager)

I've also got some expeirence with these (to varying extents)!
- Python
- Go
- Artillery.io
- Webpack / Babel
- TSDuck / ffmpeg (did some research on transport streams over multicast feeds)
- Gitlab Jobs (debugging and extending preexisting job)
- Bash scripts (automating stuff like ffmpeg and tsduck commands)
- Cron jobs
- Android Debugging Bridge and Android device testing
- I greatly enjoy setting aliases for commands that are annoying or repetitive
