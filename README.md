### Hey There ðŸ‘‹

I recently decided to pursue software engineering as a career path. I started with a couple bootcamp's basic prep courses, and some miscellaneous Youtube videos. I ended up going through one of the bootcamps, and have now been in the field since January of 2022.

I greatly enjoy working with React and think it can be very fun.

The primary technologies and languages I am comfortable with are...
- Gitlab / Github / Git
- React / NextJS
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Node / Express
- HTML and CSS
- SCSS, styled components
- MongoDB / Mongoose / Mongo Atlas / Robot3T
- Postman
- Heroku
- AWS (S3, Lambdas, Athena, Gateway, IAM, Cloudfront, Secrets Manager)

I've also got some expeirence with these to varying extents!
- Python (a couple data pipelines, and SCTE marker analysis)
- Go (some work on some simple services and built a service out from the skeleton of another)
- Artillery.io (load testing our servers)
- Webpack / Babel
- TSDuck / ffmpeg (did some research on transport streams over multicast feeds - load tested ffmpeg for video recording purposes on company servers)
- Gitlab Jobs (debugging and extending preexisting job)
- Bash scripts (automating stuff like ffmpeg and tsduck commands)
- Cron jobs (one of those data pipelines)
- Android Debugging Bridge and Android device testing
- I greatly enjoy setting aliases for commands that are annoying or repetitive - ex: just for fun, my git branch command is ```git brr```, and I have a ```git aci -m "message here"``` command alias which will add everything and commit instead of needing to use both commands separately
